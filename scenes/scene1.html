                When you close late, it's always nice seeing the Alexas slowly power down. It's an almost serene scene as they shuffle across the cafe floor to their charging stations at the back of the shop.
            </p>
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                It's reassuring too. This feeling almost makes overtime worth it.
            </p>
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                On these days, the shop is full, the tips are good, and the boss is happyâ€”today especially. What more is there to life?
            </p>
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                Not only that (which, to be fair, is already a lot), but the fact that the bots no longer interrupt you when you're winding down yourself? Pure bliss.
            </p>
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                You're reminded of the days when you actually had real coworkers, when you first started at the shop. You try so hard nowadays for it not to be about the speed or about the cash, but what else is there?
            </p>
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                It used to be everyone together, washing windows, scrubbing down coffee-stained tables, complaining about the day together.

                Now it was just Alex alone.

                Of course, you have Wally too, though you've been seeing less and less of her lately. Maybe your shifts just don't align or they've had a tough time studying... You haven't found the time to ask.

                    "Hey, Alex, not to interrupt or anything, but could you give us a sec? I need to speak with..." Your boss interrupts your thoughts.                </b>

            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                It should be laughable. You imagine a robot staring menacingly at a table... It should be laughable, but the black hole is still there.

            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                But you nod to your boss and back off, trying to shake it off as you head to grab some cleaning supplies from under the register.
            </p>    
            <p class = "line_padding"> 
                You stare and wonder. Usually, you grab the old t-shirt that ripped on your first week. But today, you have a strange hunch that you won't have to worry about Wally.
