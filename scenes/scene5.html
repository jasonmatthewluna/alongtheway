                The sun shines into your eyes as you step out of your apartment building, guitar case slung over your shoulder. The black hole, which stays the size of a tennis ball nowadays, follows eagerly at your feet like an anxious puppy.
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                You raise a hand above your face to block the light before you start your journey down the street, in search of a change in scenery that'll inspire you to create some new music. 
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                As you skate past the old cafe you used to work at, you slow down and take a look through the perfectly polished windows. The Alexas are making drinks and cleaning the tables like usual, and a third robot— <i>your replacement</i>, a voice in your head says—stands next to your old manager behind the register. He's showing the robot how to take a customer's order with a friendly smile, but you've never seen him look quite so tired. 
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                You try to push away your intrusive thoughts; you're much better off now than when you left the cafe three months ago. It doesn't matter who replaced you. 
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                You're still curious about how the cafe's doing though, so you figure it wouldn't hurt to stop for a cup of coffee. 
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                Your manager looks up as you push open the familiar doors of the cafe. His eyes brighten, and his face breaks into a tentative smile.
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                "Hey, Alex! What brings you here today?" he asks.
            </p>
            <p class="line_padding">
                You shrug, suddenly feeling a little awkward.
            </p>
