                Along the Way is the choose your own adventure story of twenty-two-year-old Alex (they/them) who lives in a world overrun by robots, and not the cool Iron Man kind. Instead, the bots are boring old service bots, brewing drinks and mopping floors. While Alex works at a local cafe as a barista—the only job they could get after college—the robots begin to replace all of their human coworkers, the only ones who were able to keep Alex sane during the hustle and bustle of the store.                <!-- <span class = "typed-text" id = "intro-text">

            Last human coworker gets laid off [Scene 1]
    
            When Alex closes late, it always gave them a bit of peace of mind seeing the Alexas slowly power down, making their way to their charging stations in the back of the shop. Alex almost didn't mind the unpaid overtime. On these types of days, the shop was full, the tips were good, and the boss was happy. What more was there to life?
            
            Not only that (which, to be fair, was already a lot), but the fact that the bots wouldn't interrupt the rest of the day while Alex wound down themself... It was just pure bliss. The shop became the only space where the bots were unable to compete with Alex, and the fact that Alex shared this moment only with their fellow human employees reminded Alex of when they first started at the shop, when it wasn't about speed but camaraderie, when they'd all wind down together, their muscles aching as they washed a window or scrubbed a sticky table.
            
            "Hey, Alex, not to interrupt or anything, but could you give us a sec? I need to speak with..."
